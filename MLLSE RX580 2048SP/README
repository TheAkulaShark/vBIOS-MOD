based on mllse 2048sp vbios https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/263838/263838

tdp increased 120w to 160w
powertune limit %50 to %80
tdc limit increased by 6amps
temp limits and shutdown temps remain the same

i expect the card to consume around 200w on full load instead of 150w stock value.
make sure to use aticlock patch after flashing or you cant install drivers

if you did flash and restart without ati clock patcher you will see the error code 43. in this case, go into safe mode and
delete old drivers using ddu, restart normally and then download 24.3 drivers. once you install them go into safemode again
and use ati clock patcher. then restart normally and continue installing amd drivers. (worked all fine for vbios modded rx 550)

newest version of amd driver such as 24.10.x might not work, 24.3 is the most stable one.

LESS POWER HUNGRY.ROM FILE IS A LESS POWERFUL VBIOS OF THE ONE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.
